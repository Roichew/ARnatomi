# ARnatomi: Augmented Reality Human Anatomi

Welcome to the ARnatomi repository! Our project aims to revolutionize health education in Indonesia by leveraging augmented reality (AR) technology to enhance the learning experience of human body organs. This README provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Overview

In Indonesia, traditional methods of teaching anatomy often rely on static images in textbooks or limited physical props, hindering students' comprehensive understanding. To address this challenge, our team has developed an innovative AR application using Unity and Vuforia technologies. This application allows users to visualize and interact with 3D models of human body organs in real-time, providing immersive learning experience.

## Installation

To use the ARnatomi application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ar-organ-learning.git

2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Unity and Vuforia.
4. Build the project for your desired platform (e.g., Android, iOS).
5. Install the built application on your device.

## Usage

1. Launch the ARnatomi application on your device.
2. Point the device's camera towards a flat surface.
3. Tap the screen to place a 3D model of an organ on the surface.
4. Use gestures to interact with the model, such as rotating, zooming, and accessing additional information.
5. Explore and learn about different organs of the human body in an immersive AR environment!
